- You can see my Notes web app by clicking on the Demo. I've hosted my project on vercel.
- It's a guided project for deeper understanding of react hooks.

### Built With

## Learnings

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

- Have developed this project to showcase my practical skills in React Js. This project helped to learn one of the react hooks concept called useState in more deeper. Here in this project I have created Notes which is fuly resposive and something cool about this web application is I have created  a dark mode for it.
